On the outside, agate geodes appear to be nothing but rock, but looking deeper into the interior of a geode will reveal amazing crystal growth and formations. Agate geode crystals are usually composed of quartz or chalcedonic deposits, but various other minerals such as calcite, celestite and dolomite are also commonly found within other varities of geodes.

Geodes occur in a wide range of vivid colors, depending on the type of crystals within. Typically, geodes contain near-colorless quartz, but amethyst crystals and other colors can also be found. Geode crystals form their own unique pattern of natural facets, which naturally heightens the brilliance, fire and intensity of color.
