<h1>Amtheyst - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst">Dionysus's Power</a></h1>
<p>Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz often used in jewelry. The name comes from the Ancient Greek <em>a</em> &ndash; ("not") and <em>methustos</em> &ndash; ("intoxicated"), a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness. The ancient Greeks and Romans wore amethyst and made drinking vessels of it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication. It is one of several forms of quartz. Amethyst is a semiprecious stone and is the traditional birthstone for February.</p>

<h2>Azotic Topaz - <a href="http://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/azotic-topaz/azotic-topaz-info.php">Forged by Man</a></h2>
<p>Azotic Topaz is a color-enhanced variety of colorless topaz. It is named after the company that invented the unique patented coating enhancement treatment, Azotic. Azotic Topaz obtains its unique rainbow-like colors through an extremely thin metallic coating of film deposition that reflects light in a variety of colors and interesting patterns.</p>

<h3>Azurite - <a href="http://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/azurite/azurite-info.php">Azure</a></h3>
<p>Azurite is a soft, deep blue copper mineral produced by weathering of copper ore deposits. It is also known as Chessylite after the type locality at Chessy-les-Mines near Lyon, France. The mineral, a carbonate, has been known since ancient times, and was mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Natural History under the Greek name <em>kuanos</em> ("deep blue," root of English cyan) and the Latin name <em>caeruleum</em>. The blue of azurite is exceptionally deep and clear, and for that reason the mineral has tended to be associated since antiquity with the deep blue color of low-humidity desert and winter skies.</p>

<h4>Amber - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber">Fossilized Resin</a></h4>
<p>Amber is fossilized tree resin (not sap), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times. Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects. Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.</p>

<h5>Black Opal - <a href="http://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/black-opal/black-opal-gemstone-information-and-education.php">Lightning Ridge</a></h5>
<p>Opal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica; its water content may range from 3% to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6% to 10%. Because of its amorphous character it is classed as a mineraloid, unlike the other crystalline forms of silica which are classed as minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl and basalt. <strong>97% of the world supply of opal originates from Austrailia, which is also its national gemstone.</strong></p>

	
<p>Of these hues, the reds against black are the most rare, whereas white and greens are the most common. It varies in optical density from opaque to semi-transparent.</p>

<h6>Labradorite - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradorite">Mystical</a></h6>
<p>Lore of the Inuit peoples claim Labradorite fell from the frozen fire of the Aurora Borealis, an ordinary stone that transforms to the extraordinary, shimmering in a mystical light that separates the waking world from unseen realms. </p>
