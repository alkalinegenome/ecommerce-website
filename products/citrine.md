Citrine is one of the most popular gemstones available today. Natural Citrine is actually quite rare and because it is more valuable than most other varieties of quartz, much of the citrine today is actually heat-treated to obtain their attractive golden color.

Citrine's color is thought to radiate positive energy. It is known as the 'success stone', promoting prosperity and abundance, especially in situations involving business. Citrine has actually earned the nickname of 'the merchant's stone', owed to the fact that many businesses will keep citrine in their cash registers for good fortune.
